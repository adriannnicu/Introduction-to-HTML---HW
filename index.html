        <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
        <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <u>Lorem Ipsum</u> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <i>1500s</i>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <i>1960s</i> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
